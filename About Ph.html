					<h2> History </h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify"> The first people in the Philippines were hunter-gatherers. However, between 3,000 BC and 2,000 BC, people learned to farm. They grew rice and domesticated animals. From the 10th AD century Filipinos traded with China and by the 12th Century AD Arab merchants reached the Philippines and they introduced Islam.
Then in 1521, Ferdinand Magellan sailed across the Pacific. He landed in the Philippines and claimed them for Spain. Magellan baptized a chief called Humabon and hoped to make him a puppet ruler on behalf of the Spanish crown. Magellan demanded that other chiefs submit to Humabon but one chief named Lapu Lapu refused. Magellan led a force to crush him. However, the Spanish soldiers were scattered and Magellan was killed.
The Spaniards did not gain a foothold in the Philippines until 1565 when Miguel Lopez de Legazpi led an expedition, which built a fort in Cebu. Later, in 1571 the Spaniards landed in Luzon. Here they built the city of Intramuros (later called Manila), which became the capital of the Philippines. Spanish conquistadors marched inland and conquered Luzon. They created a feudal system. Spaniards owned vast estates worked by Filipinos.
Along with conquistadors went friars who converted the Filipinos to Catholicism. The friars also built schools and universities. <br>

The Spanish colony in the Philippines brought prosperity – for the upper class anyway! Each year the Chinese exported goods such as silk, porcelain, and lacquer to the Philippines. From there they were re-exported to Mexico.
The years passed uneventfully in the Philippines until in 1762 the British captured Manila. They held it for two years but they handed it back in 1764 under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763. In 1872 there was a rebellion in Cavite but it was quickly crushed. However nationalist feelings continued to grow helped by a writer named Jose Rizal (1861-1896). He wrote two novels Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibusterer) which stoked the fires of nationalism.
Meanwhile, Andres Bonifacio formed a more extreme organization called the Katipunan. In August 1896 they began a revolution. Jose Rizal was accused of supporting the revolution, although he did not and he was executed on 30 December 1896. Yet his execution merely inflamed Filipino opinion and the revolution grew.
Then in 1898 came the war between the USA and Spain. On 30 April 1898, the Americans defeated the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. Meanwhile, Filipino revolutionaries surrounded Manila. Their leader, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines independent on 12 June. However, as part of the peace treaty, Spain ceded the Philippines to the USA. The Americans planned to take over.
In 1892 Jose Rizal founded a movement called Liga Filipina, which called for reform rather than revolution. As a result, Rizal was arrested and exiled to Dapitan on Mindanao.
The war between American forces in Manila and the Filipinos began on 4 February 1899. The Filipino-American War lasted until 1902 when Aguinaldo was captured. American rule in the Philippines was paternalistic. They called their policy ‘Benevolent Assimilation. They wanted to ‘Americanize’ the Filipinos but they never quite succeeded. However, they did do some good. Many American teachers were sent to the Philippines in a ship called the Thomas and they did increase literacy.
In 1935 the Philippines were made a commonwealth and were semi-independent. Manuel Quezon became president. The USA promised that the Philippines would become completely independent in 1945. <br>

However, in December 1941, Japan attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor. On 10 December 1941 Japanese troops invaded the Philippines. They captured Manila on 2 January 1941. By 6 May 1942, all of the Philippines were in Japanese hands.
However American troops returned to the Philippines in October 1944. They recaptured Manila in February 1945.
The Philippines became independent on 4 July 1946. Manuel Roxas was the first president of the newly independent nation. n Ferdinand Marcos (1917-1989) was elected president in 1965. He was re-elected in 1969. However, the Philippines was dogged by poverty and inequality. In the 1960s a land reform program began. However many peasants were frustrated by its slow progress and a Communist insurgency began in the countryside. <br>

On 21 September 1972 Marcos declared martial law. He imposed a curfew, suspended Congress, and arrested opposition leaders.
The Marcos dictatorship was exceedingly corrupt and Marcos and his cronies enriched themselves.
Then, in 1980 opposition leader Benigno Aquino went into exile in the USA. When he returned on 21 August 1983 he was shot. Aquino became a martyr and Filipinos were enraged by his murder.
In February 1986 Marcos called an election. The opposition united behind Cory Aquino the widow of Benigno. Marcos claimed victory (a clear case of electoral fraud). Cory Aquino also claimed victory and ordinary people took to the streets to show their support for her. The followers of Marcos deserted him and he bowed to the inevitable and went into exile. <br>
			
Today the Philippines is still poor but things are changing. Since 2010 the Philippine economy has grown at about 6% a year. Today there is reason to be optimistic about the future. Meanwhile, In 2016 the Philippines launched its first satellite. It was called Diwata-1. In 2020 the population of the Philippines was 106 million.

					<h2> Geography and Environment </h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify"> 
				he Philippines, officially called the Republic of the Philippines, is an island nation located in the western Pacific Ocean in Southeast Asia between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea. The country is an archipelago made up of 7,107 islands and is near the countries of Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. As of 2018, the Philippines had a population of roughly 108 million people and was the 13th most populous country in the world. 
				Philippines, island country of Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets lying about 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of Vietnam. Manila is the capital, but nearby Quezon City is the country’s most-populous city. Both are part of the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), located on Luzon, the largest island. The second largest island of the Philippines is Mindanao, in the southeast.<br> 
				The Exclusive economic zone of the Philippines covers 2,263,816 km2 (874,064 sq mi), 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its shores.
				Only approximately 1,000 of its islands are populated, and fewer than one-half of these are larger than 2.5 square kilometers (1 sq mi). Eleven islands make up 95 percent of the Philippine landmass, and two of these — Luzon and Mindanao — measure 105,000 square kilometers (40,541 sq mi) and 95,000 square kilometers (36,680 sq mi), respectively. They, together with the cluster of islands in Visayas in between them, represent the three principal regions of the archipelago that are identified by the three stars on the Philippine flag. The Philippines is broken up in many islands by the sea. This gives it the fifth longest coastline of 36,289 kilometers (22,549 mi) in the world.<br><br>
				The islands of the Philippines archipelago are subject to a maritime tropical climate with a year-round average temperature of just under 80°F. There are three seasons, the hot summer, the wet monsoon period and the cooler dry months.

The hot season runs from March to May with temperatures averaging around 85°F at their peak. The rainy monsoon season also sees warm weather with temperatures around 83°F. It starts in May and ends in October, characterized by high humidity and frequent storms. The cooler, dry season runs from November to February. January is the coolest month with averages about 78°F, but still plenty warm for a beach visit. Highland areas tend to be a little cooler than the lowlands.

The Philippines is prone to typhoons or tropical cyclones, particularly from June to October. In the summer months drought is common and can cause frequent power outages due to a shortage of water to run the hydro-electric plants.

					<h2> Demographics </h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify"> 
				The Philippines has a young population, with about 65 percent of people between the ages of 15 and 64 years. Meanwhile, about 30 percent are between zero to 14 years old. In 2019, the mean age of male household members was 37.68 years while female members had a mean age of 44.2 years. The country’s young people were seen to significantly contribute to the country’s economic recovery after experiencing prolonged COVID-19 related lockdowns.<br><br>
					
				Despite the slow population growth, the country’s population density remains among the highest in the Asia Pacific region. Yet the distribution of people was uneven as more Filipinos chose to live in urban areas where work opportunities are abundant. In fact, in 2015, Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and the National Capital Region (NCR) accounted for the highest number of inhabitants nationwide. This, in turn, created an income disparity among major capitals. In addition, the country saw a growing slum community that has been an ongoing societal issue in major urban cities.
The slum areas in the Philippines have contributed to the global share of the slum population in Southeast Asia. Although the share of the urban population living in the slums fluctuated, the lack of affordable housing and economic inequality continued to challenge the living conditions and the quality of life of those who can only afford to squat in slums.
In terms of migration, the country has developed an emigration culture, where one out of five Filipinos expressed desires to move abroad. The government also relies on this emigration culture and has positioned the country as the leading labor exporter from Asia-Pacific. <br><br>
				
With over 110 million people, the Philippines is among the most populated countries in Southeast Asia, next to Indonesia. The nation’s pro-life stance influenced by deep-seated Catholic beliefs, alongside high fertility rates, aided the population boom. However, the country’s population reflected sluggish growth in the past seven decades partly due to the increased use of contraceptives and modern family planning methods as well as the uncertainties brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

					<h2> Culture </h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify"> 
				The Philippines is a culture in which East meets West. The Filipino people have a distinct Asian background, with a strong Western tradition. The modern Filipino culture developed through influence from Chinease traders, Spanish conquistadors, and American rulers. Filipino people tend to be very hospitable, especially to Western visitors (1). Because of their strong ties to Spanish culture, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian (1). This is easily seen in the works of comporary artists such as Rody Herrera in his painting Unahan Sa Duluhan.

The family is the basic and most important aspect of Filipino culture. Divorce is prohibited and annulments are rare (2). The family is the safety net for indivuduals, especially older people, during difficult economic times. Children will often stay with their parents into adulthood, only leaving when they get married (2). Political and business ties are often influenced by family relationships (2). <br><br>

Two traits that many foreign visitors often have a difficult time understanding are Pakikisama and Utang na Loob. Pakikisama roughly means "getting along" and requires individuals overlook slight improprieties or indiscretions for the sake of preserving peace within the family, personal, or business relationship. Utang na Loob refers to the custom of paying back one favor with another (2). These traits emphasize the importance that Filipino people place on maintaining pleasant interpersonal relationships and puting the needs of the group ahead of the individual.

More than 80% of the population of the Philippines is Roman Catholic. Fiestas in honor of the patron saint of a town are quite common. Criticism of the Catholic church is not taken lightly - and should be avoided (2).

In the Philippines, people greet each other with a handshake. A smile or raised eyebrows can mean "Hello" or "Yes". Someone can be summoned with a downward wave of the hand
